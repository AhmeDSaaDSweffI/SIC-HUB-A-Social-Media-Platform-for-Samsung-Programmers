## ✨ Overview

SIC HUB brings the essentials of a social network to the desktop in a clean, self-contained package. Designed as a **private hub for Samsung programmers**, it lets members register with a profile, publish posts (with images), engage through likes and comments, discover other members, and chat together in a shared group room.

The entire application is built on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, with each responsibility isolated into its own class and module. It requires **no database server and no internet connection** — all data is persisted locally in human-readable **JSON** files.

---

## 🎯 Features

| 🔑 Category | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 🔐 **Authentication** | Secure **Register** and **Login** flow with field validation and duplicate-email checks. |
| 👤 **User Profiles** | Personal profile with **profile picture** and **cover photo** (defaults provided if none chosen). |
| 📝 **Posts** | Create posts with optional images, then **delete** them anytime from your profile. |
| ❤️ **Engagement** | **Like** posts and add **comments** on both the home feed and profile pages. |
| 🏠 **News Feed** | A scrollable home page that aggregates posts from every member of the hub. |
| 🔍 **User Search** | Fast, case-insensitive **linear search** to find members by name or email. |
| 💬 **Group Chat** | A shared, timestamped group chat room that persists across sessions. |
| 🔒 **Private Hub** | An exclusive, offline environment tailored for tech professionals. |
| 💾 **Local Persistence** | All users, posts, and messages stored in editable **JSON** files. |

## 📂 Project Structure

```text
SIC-HUB/
│
├── main.py            # 🚪 Entry point — bootstraps the app & controls page navigation
├── mainPage.py        # 🏠 Home page: news feed, likes, comments & user search
├── user_auth.py       # 🔐 Login & Register pages, plus the User model
├── user_profile.py    # 👤 Profile page: view, add & delete posts (UserManager lives here)
├── GroupChat.py       # 💬 Group chat page: send, load & persist messages
│
├── users.json         # 🗄️ User database (credentials, profiles, posts)
└── group_chat.json    # 🗄️ Group chat message log
```

### 🧭 How It Fits Together

- **`main.py`** defines `SocialMediaApp`, the central controller that swaps between pages inside a single Tkinter window.
- **`user_auth.py`** exposes `LoginPage`, `RegisterPage`, and the `User` class.
- **`user_profile.py`** exposes `UserProfilePage` and the shared **`UserManager`** helper used across modules to read/write `users.json`.
- **`mainPage.py`** renders the feed (`SocialMediaHomePage`) and drives search & engagement.
- **`GroupChat.py`** renders `GroupChatPage` and reads/writes `group_chat.json`.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- ✅ **Python 3.8 or higher** — [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- ✅ **Tkinter** — bundled with most Python installations (on some Linux distros: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`)
- ✅ **Pillow** — required for loading and rendering images

> 💡 SIC HUB loads a logo (`logooo.jpg`) and default images (`defaultProf.jpg`, `defaultCov.png`) at runtime. These are optional — the app runs without them (it simply skips missing images), but adding them gives you the full experience.

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get SIC HUB running locally:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/SIC-HUB-A-Social-Media-Platform-for-Samsung-Programmers.git
cd SIC-HUB-A-Social-Media-Platform-for-Samsung-Programmers
```

### 2️⃣ (Recommended) Create a virtual environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pillow
```

### 4️⃣ Run the application

```bash
python main.py
```

🎉 The SIC HUB window will launch, greeting you with the welcome screen.

## 🕹️ Usage

The typical user journey flows through three stages: **Authenticate → Profile → Connect**.

                        │ (posts)   │          │  Users    │          │  Comment  │     │   Chat    │
                        └───────────┘          └───────────┘          └───────────┘     └───────────┘
```

1. **🔐 Register / Login**
   - New members click **Register**, enter their name, email, and password, and optionally pick a profile & cover photo.
   - Returning members click **Login** and enter their credentials.

2. **🏠 Explore the Home Feed**
   - After login you land on the home page showing posts from every member.
   - **Like** posts (one like per user), **add comments**, or use **Search User** to find colleagues by name or email.

3. **👤 Manage Your Profile**
   - Click **Go to Profile** to view your own page.
   - **Add posts** (with optional images) or **delete** existing ones.

4. **💬 Join the Group Chat**
   - Click **Group Chat** to enter the shared room.
   - Type a message and hit **Send** — messages are timestamped and saved to `group_chat.json`, so they persist between sessions.

5. **🚪 Log Out** anytime to return to the welcome screen.

- [ ] 👤 **Private / direct messaging** between members
- [ ] 🔔 **Notifications** for likes, comments, and new messages
- [ ] 🌓 **Dark mode** and theming options
- [ ] 🗃️ **Database migration** (SQLite/PostgreSQL) for scalability
- [ ] 🌍 **Network/multi-user** support beyond a single machine
- [ ] 🧪 **Unit tests** and CI integration
- [ ] 📱 **Responsive layout** improvements for the Tkinter UI
